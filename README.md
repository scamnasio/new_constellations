# Reconstellate


A World Wide Telescope-based interface that allows users to "draw" their own constellations in the night sky and print the output. 
Currently in active development to implement the following:
- Annotate sky with names of constellations
- Possibly transfer to pywwt
- Ouput a skymap customized for current month and location with your own constellations!
